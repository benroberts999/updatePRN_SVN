! One line per entry, in the format:

! Keep 'note' short, e.g.: "OA has Rb"

  2005-12-01   2005-12-18   39   09   IIA  XX  Cs   OA has Rb (*1)
  2005-12-21   2007-10-29   39   09   IIA  XX  Cs   OA has Rb (*2)
!
! *1 (see below): OA has Rb, but there is no gap in data between previous
!    clock (Cs), and the AVAR/hist/etc. point to Cs. 
! *2 Same as above; no gap between this clock and next one (Cs), so I
!    think this one is also Cs.
! OA has PRN09 Cs->Rb on 20051201; however, no gap in data
! OA has PRN09 Rb->Cs on 20071030; however, no gap in data
